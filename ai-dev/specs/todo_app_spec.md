**Feature**: Todo Management Application **Purpose**: Allow users to create, delete, edit, and toggle completion status of todos with additional fields (title, description, priority, dueDate, createdAt, updatedAt) **Behavior**: Responsive web application displaying a list of todos sorted by due date (completed todos at bottom); add, edit (via modal dialog), delete, and toggle completion functionality; todos persist in browser localStorage; architecture ready for backend API integration later; optimistic updates for better UX **Constraints**: Must follow Hexagonal Architecture (domain/application/infrastructure/presentation layers), no business logic in UI components, use Redux Toolkit for state management, use MUI (Material-UI) for components, use Either/Result pattern for use cases, follow all React conventions from .cursor/rules, no hardcoded values, all errors must be handled, comprehensive validation logic for all fields **Acceptance Criteria**: User can create todos with title (required, min 1 char, max 200 chars), description (optional, max 1000 chars), priority (low/medium/high, default medium), dueDate (optional, ISO 8601 string, must be future date if provided); edit todos via modal dialog; delete todos (with confirmation); toggle completion status; todos sorted by due date (completed at bottom); UI follows Material Design principles via MUI; application is responsive; todos persist across page refreshes; all operations use Either/Result pattern; all operations have error handling and user feedback; validation prevents invalid data entry; todos have UUID, createdAt, and updatedAt fields
