# Context Management

**Goal**: Prevent context drift and rule dilution.

## When to Start New Session

## Rule

Start new session when:

- Milestone or large feature completed
- AI forgets repeated instructions
- AI violates architecture unexpectedly

## Session Start Checklist

## Checklist

Reference at session start:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `project_constitution.md`
- `workflow_protocol.md`
- Relevant `.cursor/rules/**` files (open file in that area)
- Continuity files (only if populated): `milestones.md`, `tech_debt_ledger.md`, `exceptions_log.md`, `GOTCHAS.md`

## Scope Control

- Work in atomic steps (1-3 files per step)
- Stop when scope expands
- Re-plan before continuing
</rule>
