# Rules: Taxonomy & Governance (Portable)

This folder defines **portable** rule knowledge (human-readable). Cursor enforcement lives in `.cursor/rules/**/*.mdc`.

## How to use

- Put **explanations, rationale, and patterns** here.
- Keep `.mdc` files short and imperative; they may reference these docs when needed.

## Contents

- `rule_taxonomy.md`: what kinds of rules exist and where they live
- `rule_lifecycle.md`: how rules evolve, how exceptions are handled
