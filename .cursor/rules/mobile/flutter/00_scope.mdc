# Mobile: Flutter (Index)

## Path convention (for scoped rules)

- Canonical path: `apps/flutter/` (symlinked to the real Flutter app directory)
- Real path (current repo): `flutter_app/`
- Code roots:
  - Domain/Application: `apps/flutter/lib/core/**` (or `flutter_app/lib/core/**`)
  - Infrastructure: `apps/flutter/lib/infrastructure/**`
  - Presentation: `apps/flutter/lib/presentation/**`

## Rule files (by concern)

- `state_bloc.mdc`: BLoC rules (presentation/state only)
- `state_riverpod.mdc`: Riverpod rules (presentation/state only)
- `ui_widgets.mdc`: widget composition and UI boundaries
- `navigation.mdc`: navigation/go_router rules
- `networking.mdc`: API client boundaries and error mapping
- `auth.mdc`: authentication boundaries
- `animations.mdc`: animation-specific guidance (only when working in animation code)
