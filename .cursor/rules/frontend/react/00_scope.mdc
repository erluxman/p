description: React web rules index (scoped to react_web/ or apps/web/). Keep rules split by concern.
globs:
  - "react_web/**"
  - "apps/web/**"
  - "frontend/**"

# React Web (Index)

- This folder contains **topic-scoped** rules. Only relevant rules should load for the files being edited.
- Always follow `project_constitution.md` and `workflow_protocol.md`.
- If you need rules outside the current concern (e.g., auth), open the relevant files so their scoped rules apply.

## Rule files (by concern)

- `components.mdc`: component patterns and boundaries
- `state.mdc`: state management conventions
- `accessibility.mdc`: a11y requirements
- `testing.mdc`: tests and test structure for frontend
